// ---- Writing a Test ----

import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import Greetings from "./Greetings";

/* ‚≠ê‚≠ê When writing a test we typically want to do THREE things (Three A's):

      1. FIRST, we want to 'Arrange'  ->  which means that we want to render the component that we want to test.    
                                                        [We can also do additional setup work if it required, like setup the test data, test conditions, and test environment]

      2. SECOND, we want to 'Act'  ->  which means that we want to DO the thing that we want to actually test.
                                            For example if we want to simulate a button click, then we need to get that button from the DOM and then click it from our test code. 
                                                        [Run logic that should be tested. ie: execute function]

      3. THIRD (last), we want to 'Assert' the results  ->  which means that we want have a look at the output thats visible in the browser, for example, and then see if that matches our expectation.
                                                        [compare execution results with expected results]

// Creating a 'Test Suite' using the 'describe()' function
describe("Greeting Component Test Suite", () => {
  test("Renders Hello World as a text", () => {
    // ---- First step   ->   'Arrange'
    render(<Greetings />);

    // ---- Second step   ->   'Act'
    // ... do nothing since we only want to check if an element was rendered, not when something changes onClick for instance

    // ---- Third step   ->   'Assert'

    /* Three types of methods we can use on 'screen' object are to get elements we want to test in Virtual DOM:
                          [Main difference between them is when these functions throw error and if they return a promise or not]
                  - 'get...' methods   ->   WILL throw an Error if an element is NOT found. 
                  - 'query...' methods   ->   WONT throw an error if an element is not found.
                  - 'find...' methods   ->   will return a promise, if an element will eventually be on the screen.
        */
    // SIDE NOTE üìù:  'getByText()' looks for an EXACT match by default so if element is rendered with 'Hello world!'  then test will fail since text casing doesn't match and there is an exclamation mark.
    const helloWorldElement = screen.getByText("Hello World", { exact: false });
    expect(helloWorldElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
